# Lit Ceramic Integration

### Quick and Dirty Instructions for running in dev

Make sure to run `yarn` to install everything at first.

This is how I've been building it, at least the first time: `npx webpack --hot && yarn parcel index.html`

But normally I just run `yarn parcel index.html`, I don't think the webpack build is absolutely necessary. I know it's not, but I fear change ðŸ˜œ

That should get things running, even though I still have some `/dist` files the html is set up to connect to the `/src`.

# To Do:

- further implement DOCUMENTATION.JS, re-run over documentation
- Finalize Readme
- clean up promise code
- swap/copy over to the LIT company owned repo
- Blogpost

## Soon:

- Allow for Lit Node (and Ceramic Node) to be editable
- Port over and clean up learnings scattered among older MD docs

## [Ceramic Web Playground](https://ceramicstudio.github.io/web-playground/)

Test the full stack of [Ceramic Network](https://ceramic.network/) components in a web browser.

## Technologies

- [Ceramic HTTP Client](https://developers.ceramic.network/reference/javascript/clients/#http-client): Provides access to the Ceramic Network via a remote node running Ceramic (and IPFS).
- [3ID Connect](https://developers.ceramic.network/build/authentication/#did-provider-or-wallet): Provides authentication to a DID (used by Ceramic) from a blockchain wallet, and stores a link from this blockchain account to your DID in IDX.
- [IDX](https://idx.xyz/): Provides a way to create identity records for a DID. Records are stored on Ceramic and can represent links to blockchain accounts or other user data.

## Usage

1. Open the [Playground page](https://ceramicstudio.github.io/web-playground/)
1. Open your console by inspecting the page
1. Authenticate by clicking "Connect wallet"
1. Approve prompts in your Web3 wallet
1. Wait to see "Connected with DID" in your console
1. Write and read documents on the Ceramic Network from the console using the referenced API methods
1. Write and read records on IDX from the console using the referenced API methods
